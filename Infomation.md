> **Note** <br/>
We never claim that the source of our script is scripted by us, we only script 45% of the open source script, we admit that we are skidders, we give this credit to those who open source the lt2 script, we thank you very much!<br/> <a href="https://discord.gg/luaware">Join Luaware Discord</a>

> **Note** <br/>
> We will give early access to people who showcase our script, provided they don't leak our v3. We have an execution log for v3 early access, so you don't just leak v3 from us.


> **Warning** <br/>
> We can see the total execution, but we can't see the username/ip/hwid of the person who executed our script, we really care about your privacy, we have never made an ip logger, you can see our source code if you don't believe it, and if anyone does slander me using ip logger you can dm me
